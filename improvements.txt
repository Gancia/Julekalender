### Code Review Findings

Overall, the code is well-structured, clean, and the functionality is solid after our debugging session. The variable names are clear, and the separation of concerns between HTML, CSS, and JS is good.

Here are a few potential improvements and minor issues I found, categorized from higher to lower importance.

#### 1. Accessibility (a11y) Improvements (Medium Importance)

Accessibility ensures that the calendar is usable by as many people as possible, including those using screen readers or keyboards.

*   **Modal Close Button:** The close button in the modal is a `<button>` element, which is great. However, it doesn't have any text content or an `aria-label` to describe what it does. A screen reader might just announce "button" or "times icon", which is not very helpful.
    *   **Suggestion:** Add an `aria-label` to the button to give it an accessible name.
        ```html
        <!-- In index.html -->
        <button onclick="closeModal()" class="modal-close-button" aria-label="Luk indholdsvisning">
            <i data-lucide="x" ...></i>
        </button>
        ```

*   **Door Interaction:** The doors are `<div>` elements. While they work perfectly with a mouse, a user navigating with a keyboard won't be able to "focus" on them or "click" them with the Enter/Space key.
    *   **Suggestion:** To make the doors fully accessible, they could be changed to `<button>` elements or be given `role="button"` and `tabindex="0"` attributes in the `createCalendar` function in `script.js`. This allows them to be focusable and operable by keyboard.

*   **Modal Role:** The modal `<div>` could be given specific ARIA roles to better announce its purpose to screen readers.
    *   **Suggestion:** Add `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` to `<div id="modal" ...>`. You could also add `aria-labelledby="modal-title"` to link the modal to its title.

#### 2. JavaScript Best Practices & Robustness (Low Importance)

The JavaScript is very clean, but a few small tweaks could make it even better.

*   **Use of `const`:** Many variables that are assigned once are declared with `let` instead of `const`. For example, in `createCalendar`, `door`, `numberSpan`, `doorInner`, etc., are never reassigned. Using `const` is a good practice as it prevents accidental reassignment.
    *   **Suggestion:** Change `let` to `const` for variables that are not reassigned within their scope. This applies to most of the element creation variables.

*   **Hardcoded Door Numbers:** The `doorNumbers` array in `createCalendar` is a hardcoded, shuffled list of numbers from 1 to 24. This works, but if you ever wanted a different order, you'd have to manually shuffle it again.
    *   **Suggestion (Optional):** If you want the order to be random every time the page loads (and not saved), you could generate and shuffle the array dynamically. If the specific shuffled order is intentional, then keeping it as is is perfectly fine.

#### 3. CSS & HTML (Very Low Importance)

*   **Inline Styles:** The `<i data-lucide="x" style="width: 28px; height: 28px;"></i>` icon has inline styles. This is a very minor point, but for better maintainability, this could be moved to the `style.css` file.
    *   **Suggestion:** Give the icon a class (e.g., `.modal-close-icon`) and style it in the CSS file.

#### 4. Editor UI/UX Polish (Medium to High Importance)

These improvements will make the editor more intuitive and user-friendly for content creators.

*   **Better Feedback with Toast Notifications:** Replace intrusive `alert()` messages (e.g., when shuffling doors or restoring a session) with less disruptive "toast" notifications. These are small, transient messages that appear in a corner of the screen and fade away automatically, providing feedback without interrupting the workflow.

*   **Collapsible Content Blocks:** For days with extensive content, managing multiple blocks can be cumbersome. Implementing functionality to collapse and expand individual content blocks (e.g., with a small arrow icon) would significantly improve overview and make reordering and editing easier.

*   **Visual Icon Picker for Custom Boxes:** Instead of selecting custom box icons from a plain dropdown list, provide a visual picker that displays the actual icons. This would make icon selection much more intuitive and faster.

#### 5. Rich Text Editing (WYSIWYG) for Text Areas (High Importance)

The current text areas display HTML tags literally (e.g., `<b>` for bold). For a more user-friendly editing experience, implement a "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) editor for all text input fields, excluding the dedicated 'HTML' block type.

*   **Suggestion:** Replace `<textarea>` elements with `contenteditable="true"` divs.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Update formatting functions (Bold, Italic, Underline) to use `document.execCommand` (or more modern Range/Selection APIs) to apply formatting directly within the `contenteditable` div.
    *   Modify save logic (`getCurrentDayDataFromForm`) to retrieve and store the `innerHTML` of the `contenteditable` div.
    *   Modify rendering logic in both editor preview (`renderPreviewModal`) and main calendar (`openDoor`) to ensure HTML content is correctly interpreted and displayed.
    *   Consider adding basic CSS for the `contenteditable` divs to visually represent them as input areas.
    *   Be mindful of potential security implications (e.g., XSS) with `contenteditable` and `innerHTML` if user-generated content could contain malicious scripts (though less likely in this closed-editor context).
